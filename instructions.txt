Hey,

I hope you're doing well.
Just heard from the client.
They're willing to pay us $2000 to build a site with the following requirements.

A jumbotron header with a tasteful off-white background.
A 2 column layout with images of their product.
A full-width navbar at the top of the screen which is responsive.
Lots of Bootstrap panels
One huge 'buy now' button at the bottom. It should do something fancy when they hover over it.
A footer with lots of buttons and images.


Is that cool?
Let me know ASAP.
Thanks!
